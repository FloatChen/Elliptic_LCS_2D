Citation:

Please cite [1] if you use the code in your own work.

Please also cite the theoretical work underlying my implementation  as follows:

— OrbitDetection.m and eta_tracing.m are implemented based on [2].

— DetectEllipticRegion.m and SettingPoincareSection.m are implemented based on [3]. 

— SingularityDetection.m is implemented based on [5]. 

— cgTensor.m is implemented based on [4].

Tested on Matlab R2015b.

Installation notes :

1) After you unzipped the files to mydir, 
   put the Current Directory in Matlab to mydir

2) In the Matlab command prompt,
   type "add_path" to add the necessary folders to the top of the search path

3) You can now try any of the examples

The altimeter products used in this work are produced by SSALTO/DUACS and distributed by AVISO, 
with support from CNES (http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/duacs).
